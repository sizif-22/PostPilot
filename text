You are using Firebase Authentication with Google and Facebook providers, which is a solid choice for social sign-in. The general
  flow is to sign the user in on the client, create a user record in your Firestore database if one doesn't exist, and then manage the
  session using a cookie.

  While this approach works, there are several areas for improvement, particularly regarding security and code structure.

  Security Analysis


   1. Client-Side Token Storage: Your biggest security vulnerability is storing the identity provider's (Google/Facebook) access token in
      a client-side cookie that is accessible to JavaScript.
       * Vulnerability: This makes the token vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious
         JavaScript into your site, they can steal this token and potentially gain access to the user's account on the respective
         platform.
       * Recommendation: The standard practice is to send the ID token (not the access token) received from the provider to your own
         backend. Your backend should then verify this token using the Firebase Admin SDK, create its own session (e.g., a secure,
         HttpOnly cookie), and return that session cookie to the client. The client would then use this session cookie for all subsequent
         requests to your backend. This prevents the token from being accessible to any client-side scripts.


   2. Cookie Security: The cookie postPilotUserCookie is not configured with security best practices in mind.
       * Recommendation: When setting cookies, you should use the following flags:
           * secure: true: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
           * httpOnly: true: Prevents the cookie from being accessed by JavaScript. This is the most critical flag for mitigating XSS.
           * sameSite: 'strict' or 'lax': Helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.


   3. Backend API Authentication: It's unclear from this one file how your API routes are protected.
       * Recommendation: Every API route that performs a protected action (e.g., creating a post, fetching user data) must validate the
         user's session on the server-side. This typically involves reading the session cookie, validating it, and then fetching the
         user's details from your database. You should not trust that a request is legitimate just because it's coming from your
         frontend.

  Code Quality & Best Practices


   1. Code Duplication: The addUserWithGoogle and addUserWithFacebook functions are nearly identical.
       * Recommendation: You can refactor this into a single, more generic function that accepts the Firebase provider
         (GoogleAuthProvider, FacebookAuthProvider, etc.) as an argument. This will make your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and less
         prone to errors.


   2. User Experience:
       * The use of window.location.reload() after creating a new user can be a jarring experience. It would be smoother to update the
         application's state with the new user information without a full page reload.
       * The window.location.href = "/" redirect is fine, but a better user experience is often to redirect the user back to the page
         they were on before they started the sign-in process.


   3. Error Handling: The current error handling logs errors to the console.
       * Recommendation: For a production application, you should implement more robust error handling. This could include showing
         user-friendly error messages on the UI and logging the detailed errors to a dedicated monitoring service (like Sentry,
         LogRocket, etc.).


   4. Hardcoded Avatar: The user's avatar is hardcoded.
       * Recommendation: You should use the photoURL provided by the authentication provider. You have it commented out in your code, so
         it seems you are aware of it. You can fall back to a default avatar if the provider doesn't supply one.
